# Web Programming

***Warning - Bad Code Ahead***

This is a term-project I did for Web programming course, during which I was
taught PHP. The project required frontend, SQL, and backend server
configuration skill, none of which were taught, so the code is a mess.
The good thing is that I managed to learn as I went, and also I managed to
docker this up.

Whole thing implements a primitive wiki service, with an incomplete parser.

- `wiki-mysql` includes DB Dockerfile, and schema SQL.
- `wiki-nginx` includes Nginx configurations.
- `wiki-php` includes the application scripts.
