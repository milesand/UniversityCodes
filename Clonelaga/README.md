# A Galaga Clone (That isn't very good)

This is an Unity project I did for C class(See below). It's a Galaga-like
shooter that uses Galaga assets.

When I started working on this, I had no knowledge of Unity; no more than
that it exists. I did manage to teach myself Unity and hack this one up, within
the project deadline. The game's not that good and the code inside is probably
ugly, but it works.

## C class

This is an Unity project I did for C class.

Sometime in the second half of the semester, the professor gave out assignment
which was to write a game in C. Except by then, the professor knew about me a
bit; He knew that I already knew C, more than what the curriculum covers. So he
specifically told me to do this with Unity, using C#, and also that I should do
a Galaga-like shooter. So I did.

He was a peculiar professor.
