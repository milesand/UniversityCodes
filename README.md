# Assignment codes

Pieces of code I wrote for university assignments.
See individual directories for commentary.

Other assignment codes that have their own repository:

* [Capstone](https://github.com/milesand/capstone-project): A cloud storage server and a web interface.
* [Software engineering](https://github.com/milesand/se-term-project):
  An incremental path-finding algorithm; The focus of the class was designing with UML, but no UML files
  in there.
